      <description>Disclaimer: As I&amp;rsquo;m used to the french/european tech industry context, I may be strongly biased and talk about general principles or views that do not apply to other contexts. Feel free to reach me on any social plarform or via email to discuss about those perceptions differences.
Site Reliability Engineering&amp;rsquo;s goal is to ensure that software systems and services that are created in an organization are made to evolve easily and especially to be extremely reliable.</description>

      <description>The roots of the project As many other tech workers in startups, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on pretty large scale projects (even if that&amp;rsquo;s subjective). I&amp;rsquo;m talking about projects involving machine learning, for example, that are often about showing the right advertisment to the right person at the right moment. Training the machine learning models for that requires a lot of resources (CPU, RAM, GPU, etc.). The same is true with APIs that are in charge of collecting data from the clients (the data will very often be used to train the ML models).</description>

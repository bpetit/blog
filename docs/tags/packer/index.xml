&lt;p&gt;If you operate an IaaS infrastructure, either private (OpenStack, OpenNebula, &amp;hellip;) or public cloud (AWS, GCP, &amp;hellip;), you certainly already wondered how to properly bootstrap your first virtual machines templates. IaaS solutions are often linked to a public repository of basic virtual machines images that can be used to quickly start deploying instances. If this is good for initial tests, it&amp;rsquo;s not that safe to bootstrap all your instances from a guest operating system someone you don&amp;rsquo;t has built for you. You then certainly want to build your own images and you want that part to be automated to (why running a fully automated infrastructure and still provisioning guest OS by hand ?). Why not use PXE for this ? Well, you&amp;rsquo;d have to deploy and maintain a dhcp and http server just for that purpose. Deploying new distributions and their releases on that server is not that cumfortable neither.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
